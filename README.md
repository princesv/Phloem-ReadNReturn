# Phloem ReadNReturn

The app is the data management app of my startup Phloem Read and return. The idea behind Phloem is to lend books and study materials to students during COVID pandemic who are unable to go to their schools or libraries because of lockdown. We collect our customers responces via a Google form and process our transaction with them. The app integrated with Pager Duty services helps us increase out work efficiency to a great extent. It instantly notifies our team as soon as there is a new response in the Google form and lets any one of our team members to acknowledge it. The app also notifies other team members about status update of every single order placed.
